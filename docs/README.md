# PrismLoader — Documentation

PrismLoader is a mod loader for **Geometry Dash** on Linux (Steam/Proton).
It injects into the game as a proxy DLL, scans memory for GD/cocos2d, hooks key
functions, and loads mods from the user's mod directory.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Build and install the proxy DLL into the GD directory
./scripts/install-proton.sh

# 2. Launch Geometry Dash normally from Steam
#    (the loader injects itself automatically)

# 3. Watch the logs
find ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/322170 -name prismloader.log
```

## Status

See the [Status section in AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) and [Debugging](./debugging.md).
The loader currently works end-to-end (proxy, pattern scan, hooks, mod loading,
the "Mods" menu button), but a live in-game test is blocked by a Steam API crash
that is independent of PrismLoader.
